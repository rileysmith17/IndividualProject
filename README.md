# IndividualProject
My individual Project for my Senior Inquiry Class
Riley Smith

This project was completed by following a tutorial on youtube by gamesplusjames. https://youtu.be/GrQalFLtQT4
Assets came from https://www.kenney.nl/assets/platformer-pack-redux. A greatwebsite with lots of free to use assets!

This project is an endless runner game in which the user attempts to run and jump along a never ending chain of platforms.
In order for this to function it is capable of generating an infite number of platforms, coins, and spikes. There is a 
small number of recycled objects which are used in order to prevent wasted memory and processing power. The goal of this
game is simply to run and survive as long as possible. Your highscore is saved even if you exit the game, so you can will
never lose track of your progress. I highly recomend taking the time to follow James' tutorial; I learned an incredible
amount about C#, Unity, and game development in general. It is getting slightly dated, but if you use a coding program
which gives you proper recomondations on how to update the obsolete code then it is no problem at all.
